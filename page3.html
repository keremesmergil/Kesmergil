        <h1>History of Soccer</h1>
      
        <p>So, the history of soccer goes very back in time. But, it is known that it has officially begun in England in 1863 Previously there were a lot of sports which were similar to soccer but none of them was the soccer which we play right now. So, we can say that soccer has evolved day by day and time by time. For example, previously while playing soccer goalkeepers were not wearing gloves but after while soccer has evolved and goalkeepers started to wear gloves. So, the advantage of gloves for the goalkeepers is it saves their hands from damage when a ball comes to their hand fastly. In addition, when soccer was first invented there was no penalty kicks or offside rule. So, those were all added after soccer was invented. To sum up, we can say that soccer is evolving time by time we don't know what rules will be implemented in soccer after 100 years. Right now one of the biggest systems implemented in soccer is the VAR system which allows referees to use technology while giving a decision about a position. This will be quite off-topic but some people were against the CAR system which they thought that it will intervene in the flow of the game. So, they were strongly against implementing the VAR system inside soccer. But the VAR system aims to minimize the errors made by the referees. So, VAR is a system in which referees can watch a position from a screen during the game and they can change their decision by looking at the VAR. So, as I mentioned before the main aim of VAR is to decrease the referee errors inside the game. but, still with the VAR systems referees can sometimes give wrong decisions. </p>
