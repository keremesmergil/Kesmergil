    <h1>About me</h1>
    <p>I was born in Istanbul,Turkey in 2002. In my chilhood years I was so interested in playing soccer and tennis. My father always insisted me playing tennis because he is playing tennis and he also wanted me to play tennis. So, ina very young age I started playing tennis, and to be honest I really liked it. But most of my friends were playing tennis when we were young so I also played soccer with them besides playing tennis. So, my high school life is also interesting I went to high school in Istanbul and I received an IB program I took classes such as Physics, Math, Economics. I had a good relationship with my professors and ı always tried to listen their advises. In 12th grade I applied for George Washington University and sent an early decision application in December I received my acceptance and I attend George Washington University. Right now I am a freshmen and this is my second semester in George Washington Universtiy</p>


    

    <h2>My Aim</h2>
    <p>So, my aim is teaching soccer to everyone I think that soccer is a really nice sport to play and I think it is not very well known sport by everyone so my aim is reaching as much as people that I can reach and give them some brief knowledge about soccer. I know that every people might not be interested in soccer or they might not be interested in playing soccer but by the information that I give everybody can have a brief knowledge about soccer and I think they will all like it when they discover my sebsite. Soccer is a passion which comes from childhood for me. In Turkey I support Galatasaray and when I am in Turkey I try to go to every match of Galatasaray and try to support my team and I enjoy the moment when I go to a stadium to watch the team that ı support. So, I also want people to soccer as I see. I also want to inject them the ambitious enivornment of soccer and give as much as information about soccer. To sum up, my main aim is giving a brief knowledge about soccer to people who visit my website and persuade them in watching soccer games</p>
