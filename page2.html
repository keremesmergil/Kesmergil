        <h1>About me</h1>
        <p>I was born in Istanbul, Turkey in 2002. In my childhood years, I was so interested in playing soccer and tennis. My father always insisted on me playing tennis because he is playing tennis and he also wanted me to play tennis. So, at a very young age I started playing tennis, and to be honest I liked it. But most of my friends were playing tennis when we were young so I also played soccer with them besides playing tennis. So, my high school life is also interesting I went to high school in Istanbul and I received an IB program I took classes such as Physics, Maths, Economics. I had a good relationship with my professors and ı always tried to listen to their advice. In 12th grade I applied for George Washington University and sent an early decision application in December I received my acceptance and I attend George Washington University. Right now I am a freshman and this is my second semester at George Washington University</p>
    

        <h2>My Aim</h2>
        <p>So, I aim to teach soccer to everyone I think that soccer is a nice sport to play and I think it is not a very well-known sport by everyone so I aim to reach as many as people that I can reach and give them some brief knowledge about soccer. I know that every people might not be interested in soccer or they might not be interested in playing soccer but by the information that I give everybody can have a brief knowledge about soccer and I think they will all like it when they discover my website. Soccer is a passion that comes from childhood for me. In Turkey I support Galatasaray and when I am in Turkey I try to go to every match of Galatasaray and try to support my team and I enjoy the moment when I go to a stadium to watch the team that ı support. So, I also want people to soccer as I see. I also want to inject them with the ambitious environment of soccer and give as much information about soccer. To sum up, my main aim is to give a brief knowledge about soccer to people who visit my website and persuade them in watching soccer games. Sometimes people get close to football with prejudice because they think that it is a time-wasting event to watch. They have an idea that the only thing that players do is run with the ball but they shouldn't think like that I think if you know the rules and the meaning of the game then soccer becomes an entertaining sport to watch. So, I aim to make people love soccer</p>
