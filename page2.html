    <h2>About me</h2>
    <p>I was born in Istanbul,Turkey in 2002. In my chilhood years I was so interested in playing soccer and tennis. My father always insisted me playing tennis because he is playing tennis and he also wanted me to play tennis. So, ina very young age I started playing tennis, and to be honest I really liked it. But most of my friends were playing tennis when we were young so I also played soccer with them besides playing tennis. So, my high school life is also interesting I went to high school in Istanbul and I received an IB program I took classes such as Physics, Math, Economics. I had a good relationship with my professors and Ä± always tried to listen their advises. In 12th grade I applied for George Washington University and sent an early decision application in December I received my acceptance and I attend George Washington University. Right now I am a freshmen and this is my second semester in George Washington Universtiy </p>
