        <h3>Rules of Soccer</h3>
        <p>So, there are some certain rules of Soccer. The first rule is none of the players except the goalkeepers can use their hands during the game. So, soccer is a sport which is played by using the foot. That's why except for the goalkeeper's other players can not use their hands. Players can use their hands only if they are using a throw-in. In addition, goalkeepers can not use their hands in every area of the pitch the only area that they can use their hands is the specified area for them. The second rule is players have to leave the pitch if they receive a red card if they refuse to leave the pitch it is an action against the rules. The third rule is the duration of the games is 90 minutes which is divided into two halves. So, every half is 45 minutes in total without the extra time. Another rule is in each game every team can make a maximum of 3 substitutions during the game, this rule has been modified in some leagues but normally in most leagues, every team can make 3 substitutions.</p>
        
        <h4>About champions league and the team which won the Champions League in 2020/21 season</h4>
