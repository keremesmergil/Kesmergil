        <h1>History of Soccer</h1>
      
        <p>So, the history of soccer goes very back in time. But, it is known that it has officially begain in England in 1863 Previously there were a lot of sports which was similar to soccer but none of them was the soccer which we play right now. So, we can basically say that soccer has evolved day by day and time by time. For example, previosuly while playing soccer goalkeepers were not wearing gloves but after a while soccer has evolved and goalkeepers started to wear gloves. So, the advantage of gloves for the goalkeepers is it saves their hands from damage when a ball comes to their hand fastly. In addition, when soccer was first invented there was no penalty kicks or offside rule. So, those were all added after the soccer was invented. To sum up, we can say that soccer is evolving time by time we don't know what rules will be implemented to soccer after 100 years. Right now the one of the biggest system implemented in soccer is the VAR system which allows refeerees to use technolgy while giving a decision about a position.</p>
